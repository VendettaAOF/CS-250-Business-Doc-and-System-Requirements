# CS-255-Business-Doc-and-System-Requirements

•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The overall goal of the DriverPass project was to design a system for Liam, the owner of DriverPass, that would give new drivers an opportunity to learn how to drive before going to the DMV to test for their license. This was accomplished by designing systems for customers to access online learning materials and quizzes. As well as systems for reserving physical lessons with an instructor.  
•	What did you do particularly well?
I really enjoyed building the various diagrams. Iterating over these documents and building out a visual representation of what the project and systems all do was interesting to me. I feel like this was the part of the project I excelled at the most.
•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Writing out the system requirements was a lot more difficult than I thought it would be. Particularly when deciding what the functional requirements need to be. It was hard to know how detailed each aspect needed to be laid out, without getting too verbose. While also not missing key details or assumptions. 
•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Every software project is ultimately being built to some sort of client spec. If key details from the client are missed the resulting product could be wildly different than the client intended. Which would likely lead to large parts of the system needing to be redesigned. 
•	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Once the requirements are gathered from the client. I prefer to build out a data flow diagram. This way I can analyze how to best approach data management for the system.
